## Introduction

The **sentinelhub** Python package is the official Python interface for [Sentinel Hub services](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/). It supports most of the services described in the [Sentinel Hub documentation](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/) and any type of [satellite data collections](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/data/), including Sentinel, Landsat, MODIS, DEM, and custom collections produced by users.

The package also provides a collection of basic tools and utilities for working with geospatial and satellite data. It builds on top of well known packages such as `numpy`, `shapely`, `pyproj`, etc. It is also a core dependency of [`eo-learn`](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-learn) Python package for creating geospatial data-processing workflows.

The main package resources are [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinelhub-py), [documentation page](https://sentinelhub-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [Sentinel Hub forum](https://forum.sentinel-hub.com/).


## Installation

The package requires a Python version >= 3.8. The package is available at the PyPI package index and can be installed with

```
$ pip install sentinelhub
```

or with an extension tag for additional functionalities

```
$ pip install sentinelhub[AWS]  # extra dependencies for interacting with Amazon Web Services
```

Alternatively, the package can be installed with Conda from `conda-forge` channel

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge sentinelhub
```

To install the package manually, clone the repository and run

```
$ pip install .
```

Before installing `sentinelhub` on **Windows** it is recommended to install `shapely` package from
[Unofficial Windows wheels repository](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)

Once installed the package can be configured according to [configuration instructions](https://sentinelhub-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configure.html) in documentation.
